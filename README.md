# :robot: PROJECT: CERCI (**C**alculating **E**rror in **R**ealtime from **C**omputer **I**nteractions)

## :brain: An advanced AI designed to simulate human interaction 
- CERCI, short for '**C**alculating **E**rror in **R**ealtime from **C**omputer **I**nteractions', is a custom made deep learning model aimed at simulating a human interaction
- CERCI will be created using Python and C++

## :hourglass: Plans
* Have CERCI be able to have a one on one conversation with a memory bank of previous interactions using recurrent neural networks
* Provide CERCI with sight and hearing using convolutional neural networks
* Train CERCI on the GPU using Nvidia CUDA
* Provide CERCI with her own voice to communicate back
* Have realtime analysis for fluent conversations

## :pushpin: TODO
* Add batch normalization to the network
* Add weight initializing functions using the proper weight generation techniques
* Make some of the class functions return a value and not just update the original value, possibly make them into their own subfunctions outside of the class
* Cleanup the files and optimize the matrix operations and misc functions
* Cleanup the 'shape' feature wherever it is called as it can now be accessed with th
* Remove unused functions from the misc library
