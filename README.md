# :robot: PROJECT: CERCI - 
## :brain: An advanced AI designed to simulate human interaction 

- CERCI or '' is a custom made deep learning model aimed at simulating a human interaction
- CERCI will be created using Python and C++

## :hourglass: Plans
* Have CERCI be able to have a one on one conversation with a memory bank of previous interactions using recurrent neural networks
* Provide CERCI with sight and hearing using convolutional neural networks
* Train CERCI on the GPU using Nvidia CUDA
* Provide CERCI with her own voice to communicate back
* Have realtime analysis for fluent conversations
